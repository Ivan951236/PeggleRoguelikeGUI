A program that makes Peggle Roguelike easy!

Peggle Roguelike Preset Generator allows you to play Peggle in a Roguelike matter in a easy and automated way!
It's already cross-platform, it's already made for many platforms such as:
Desktop:
         Windows
         Linux
Mobile:
         Android

I don't have the MacOS machine to make MacOS release for, so for MacOS users, cry about it >:)

And that's about it for the description, anyways it does generate the followings tho as part of the preset:
* Inventory
* Peggle Levels + rewards
* Boss Level
